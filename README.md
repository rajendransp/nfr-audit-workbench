# nfr-audit-workbench
NFR Audit Workbench is a local-first tool to detect performance, scalability, and reliability risks in code. It combines deterministic scans (regex/ripgrep, optional Roslyn) with local Ollama review to validate findings, suggest fixes, and generate JSON/Markdown/SARIF reports with an interactive UI for triage and prioritization.
